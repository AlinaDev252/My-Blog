# My-Blog

Personal Blog Website

This project is part of my Udacity Nanodegree Program - Front End Web Developer.

For this project, I utilized my HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling.
Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

Project Files
In this project, I had the oppportunity to start from scratch!
The mandatory HTML files were related to:

- the blog website;
- a blog post;
- any related CSS files for styling.
